            <h3><i>Climb the Vault, its wisdom awaits.</i></h3>
            <p>The Vault of Knowledge, a cool-toned vertical realm with cosmic architecture and variety of puzzles. 
                It is the sixth realm the player visits, set almost entirely indoors with its difficulty significantly lesser than of Golden Wasteland. 
                The Vault has 8 separated areas[1], however the realm has physical 7 floors (excluding the side areas) each representing the previous realms.</p>

        <h2>Secret Area</h2>
            <p>The Secret Area (also known as The Office) was added to the game in Patch 0.6.0. 
                It can be found by players with a sharp eye in the Vault of Knowledge. 
                The Secret Area is set up as a sort of parallel universe or gateway from the world of Sky into a world much more like our real world, featuring an office block based on the office of the staff behind Sky, thatgamecompany.

                If you haven't yet visited the Secret Area, it is advised to try and find it yourself and explore it spoiler-free before reading this page. However, 
                note that players will need a special cosmetic item to actually get inside the area properly. Find out more in the Secret Area page.</p>
