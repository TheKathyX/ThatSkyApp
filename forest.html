            <p>Hidden Forest, often shortened to Forest, is a concealed woodland with meditative rainfall. 
                It is the third realm the player enters, introducing the main gimmick for Forest: Rainfall. Rainfall begins after player passes the first gate in the Forest Clearing. 
                It passively drains the player's light whenever they are unsheltered, which can be recharged by standing near a light source, or interacting with a friend. 
                Hidden Forest is separated into seven areas. While the game does not explicitly mention the names of all the areas, it can be derived from landmarks and developer mentions. 
                For reading simplicity, this page will be sectioning the areas further in depth. 
                Throughout the realm is Assembly treehouses, smaller branches of the main Treehouse which hold quests for the Season of Assembly.</p>
